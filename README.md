# Investigation-of-Cortical-Traveling-Waves-in-Array-dataset
**Summary:**
In this project, we'll analyze the local field potential (LFP) activity recorded in the motor cortex using a multi-electrode array. While the task focuses on encoding working memory in Premotor Area F5, our primary objective is to examine the presence and characteristics of mesoscopic traveling waves in area F5 using phase-based methods like phase gradient directionality (PGD). Understanding task timings is essential, but detailed task intricacies are secondary for this investigation.
